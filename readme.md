# Currency Converter

We will be using JavaScript to make a currency converter utility. A folder is provided for you, with empty HTML and CSS files.

## Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository

## Requirements
* Create a single page using HTML/CSS that contains an input field, two dropdown list, and a submit button, all within a form element.
* Additionally, add a clear button.
* Create two dropdown lists of currency codes to indicate the original currency and the target currency you're trying to convert to.
* When the submit button is pressed, convert the inputted currency amount using the appropriate conversion formula (may need this [API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/))

## User Experience

1. User puts in a value into the text field
2. User chooses original currency code
3. User chooses target currency code
2. User clicks on submit button
3. The page gets updated with the converted currency value.
4. Clicking a "Clear" button resets the text field


## Deliverables

See the screenshot below for an example. Don't feel like you need to do it exactly the same though. Be creative with CSS!
